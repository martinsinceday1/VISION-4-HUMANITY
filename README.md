We are dedicated to helping the needy and neglected children and women in South Sudan. Vision for Humanity South Sudan Holistic approach focuses on women’s and children’s basic needs like education, development, intervention, protection, care and overall development. Our beginning was simple, the intention was to create support structures that would help provide tools like education, shelter, food, and hope for those children and women of marginalized communities across South Sudan. We actively run and manage numerous grassroots level initiatives that facilitate basic education and development services for underprivileged children and women in communities in South Sudan
